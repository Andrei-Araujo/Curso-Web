        <p>In 1833 the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission created the Legislative Council of Ceylon, the first step in representative
        government in British Ceylon. Initially the Legislative Council consisted of 16 members: the British Governor, the five
        appointed members of the Executive Council of Ceylon, four other government officials and six appointed unofficial
        members (three Europeans, one Sinhalese, one Tamil and one Burgher).</p>
        <p>In 1889 the number of appointed unofficial members was increased to eight (three Europeans, one Low Country Sinhalese,
        one Kandyan Sinhalese, one Tamil, one Muslim and one Burgher).[2]</p>
        <p>The Legislative Council was reformed in 1910 by the McCallum Reforms. Membership was increased to 21 of which 11 were
        officially appointed and 10 were unofficial (two elected Europeans, one elected Burgher, one elected educated Ceylonese,
        two appointed Low Country Sinhalese, two appointed Tamils, one appointed Kandyan Sinhalese and one appointed Muslim).[3]
        Less than 3,000 Ceylonese were eligible to vote for the four elected unofficial members.[3]</p>
        <p>Further reforms were enacted in 1920 by the First Manning Reforms. Membership was increased to 37 of which 14 were
        officially appointed and 23 were unofficial (11 elected on a territorial basis, five elected Europeans, two elected
        Burghers, one elected to represent the Chamber of Commerce, two appointed Kandyan Sinhalese, one appointed Muslim and
        one appointed Indian Tamil.[4]</p>
